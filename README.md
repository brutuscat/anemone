# Medusa

This is the *old* Medusa fork of the Anemone gem.

**See the new and revamped [Medusa Crawler gem](https://github.com/brutuscat/medusa-crawler) instead: https://github.com/brutuscat/medusa-crawler**

> Medusa is a web spider framework that can spider a domain and collect useful information about the pages it visits. It is versatile, allowing you to write your own specialized spider tasks quickly and easily.
